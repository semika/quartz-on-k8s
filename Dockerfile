#--publish asks Docker to forward traffic incoming on the host’s port 8000, to the container’s port 8080 (containers have their own private set of ports,
# so if we want to reach one from the network, we have to forward traffic to it in this way;
# otherwise, firewall rules will prevent all network traffic from reaching your container, as a default security posture).
#--detach asks Docker to run this container in the background.
#--name lets us specify a name with which we can refer to our container in subsequent commands, in this case bb.
